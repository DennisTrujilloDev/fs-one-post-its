# <strong>How It's Made:</strong>
<strong>Tech used</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express

The submission of a post-it note is sent to the server and later saved to a collection on MongoDB. The data then flows from the database to the server, then sent as a response and rendered dynamically through EJS.

# <strong>Lesson Learned:</strong>

 I practiced using EJS and learned to not comment out JavaScript embedded into HTML on EJS files because only the HTML is commented out (not the JavaScript).
