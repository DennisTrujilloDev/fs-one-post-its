# <strong>How It's Made:</strong>
<strong>Tech used</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express

The user fills out their note and submits it. This submission is sent as a request to the server. The details of their note is sent and stored to a database in MongoDB. Then, the server requests the data from the database, the data is sent as a response to the front-end so that the information can be rendered dyanmically through EJS.

# <strong>Lesson Learned:</strong>

 I practiced using EJS, a simple templating language that allow us to generate HTML markup with Javascript.
